Convention layout of my web :

As seen, each bloc in my page have its own html content and style sheet. These informations 
are in two separated files .html and .css, stored respectively in /html_lang/ and /styles/. 

1. The path of the style(.css) file must be informed in the .html file, this help that the .html
file can be visualized independently. 
concretly in a _*.html file must have a unique link tag in form
<link id="contentstyle" href="url_to_style_file.css" .../> 
Seence, loading and .html page of content bloc can also secondly load its style href and modified in the index page

2. The content Label :
example : cv, home, contact, ....
from content label, we can deal with many informations in the local html file: 
- file name that contain the content blocs       _mLabel.html  
- classes in this file for using style without conflict class="_mLabel"
- the id of the navigation item in the sidebar bloc id="mLabel"
-+ the class of the actual $(div#content) class="mLabel"
