%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is polymorphism? Given three geometry types : Rectangle, Triangle, Circle that all need to calculate their area. How would you write those classes?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Polymorphism is the ability to call different methods at run-time based on an object’s dynamic type. 
	\item Candidate is expected to write a BaseGeometry class, and all concrete geometries inherite from this class with a method \lstinline{virtual double calculateArea() const;}.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is wrong with the following code?
\begin{lstlisting}
void printNode(Node* pNode)
{
    std::cout << pNode->getValue() << std::endl;
}

\begin{solution}[.2in]
Regression is the estimation of a rv in relation to other rv. Mathematically, that estimate the conditional expectation. Linear regression make hypothesis two variables are linearly linked and estimate this linearity. Regression is indeed a parametric estimation. One should know how to virtually test the regression with simulated data, before applying to real data.

\question If a simulator simulate 1M values of uniform law vs Gaussian law, what should be the layout of values between -1 and 1? How to test if the gaussian simulation is correct?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Uniform simulation will give the set of points uniformly distributed in the segment, Gaussian simulation will give the set of points more dense in the center of the segment. To test if the Gaussian simulation is correct, one should calculate sample mean and sample variance, and compare with the Gaussian parameters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question If the US interest rate raise, what will be expected the FX of pound price against dollar?

Interest rate increases means the value of the money increase. By comparing to other money, dollar will be stronger, so pound will be cheaper.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question An invester want to sell a huge amount of a certain security. He split in small chunks and put in the order books at different choice of time to optimize his executions. Why he need to do so? How the price will behave, why?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Following naturally the demand-offer balance, if there are more sellers, the price will move down. Invester should split a huge trade into small chunk to minimize the price impact.
