\section{Motivation questions}
\renewcommand{\questionlabel}{Phone.~\thequestion.}
Since we don't have too much time for the phone interview, the main purpose is 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Check if everything mentioned in the CV is true, and the candidate is good at what he has done.
  \item Check the motivation of the candidate.
  \item Check the suspicious (discontinuous) in the career path.
\end{itemize}
Below are a few suggestions without answer :

\begin{questions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question We're interested in your experiences/background. How did you imagine the job in Ancoa, and how do you imagine your background would contribute to Ancoa?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	This question check not only if the candidate interest to the company/business, but also get know the creativity of the candidate. After their answer, we can also talk about how we're interested and how we imagine the candidate can add value to Ancoa.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Point randomly to a few keywords/technologies in the last experiences and ask the candidate to talk about it.

We can also pick some quick question that does not require a draft, that the candidate know or don't know. But remember to note it down, in case we invite the candidate to the face-to-face interview, we don't ask the same question.
\end{questions}

\begin{questions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question How many bits in a byte?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	8
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is inheritance?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	Inheritance is a process of creating new classes from existing classes.	New classes inherit some of the properties and behavior of the existing classes. An existing class that is "parent" of a new class is called a base class. New class that inherits properties of the base class is called a derived class
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question When would you use a virtual destructor?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Virtual destructors are useful when you can delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to base class. Always make base classes' destructors virtual when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically. If this is not done deleting the pointer to the base class results in undefined behaviour (most likely ‘slicing’).
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What does the keyword 'override' do?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
The override keyword serves two purposes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It shows the reader of the code that "this is a virtual method, that is overriding a virtual method of the base class."
	\item The compiler also knows that it's an override, so it can "check" that you are not altering/adding new methods that you think are overrides.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Which functions are defined for you if you do not define them in a class?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
In C++03 there are 4:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Default constructor: Declared only if no user-defined constructor is declared. Defined when used
	\item Copy constructor - declared only if the user hasn't declared one. Defined if used	
	\item Copy-assignment operator same as above	
	\item Destructor same as above	
\end{itemize}	
In C++11 there are 2 more :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Move constructor
	\item Move-assignment operator	
\end{itemize}	
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		\hline
		Feature & new, delete & malloc, free \\
 		\hline
		Memory allocated from & Free Store & Heap\\
 		\hline

		\hline
		Required size & calculated by compiler & Must be specified in bytes\\
		\hline

\question Name a container that has random access iterators in C++11 STL?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	vector, array
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is not of not of the number 10. (\lstinline{!!10}).
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	\lstinline{true}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference between overriding and overloading a function?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Overloading: changing the original types for/number of arguments in the signature of a method. Overriding: changing the original definition of a method
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Which STL function can be used to sort a linked list?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	\lstinline{std::list::sort}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference between the copy constructor and the move constructor?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
A copy constructor takes its argument by lvalue reference and a move constructor by rvalue reference.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Which keyword do you use if you want to update a member variable in a const class?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	\lstinline{mutable}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Can you given 2 examples of design patterns and when you might use them?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Below are a few creational design patterns :
\begin{description}
	\item[Singleton] Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and Provide a global access point to the object.
	\item[Factory] Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and Refers to the newly created object through a common interface.
	\item[Factory Method] Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate and Refers to the newly created object through a common interface.
	\item[Abstract Factory] Offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.
	\item[Builder] Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate and Allows a finer control over the construction process.
	\item[Prototype] Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
	\item[Object Pool] Reuses and shares objects that are expensive to create.
\end{description}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the size of an empty class of lambda?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Empty class of lambda is a stateless object that take the minimum size 1.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference of vector, list and map. What is the appropriated use for each containter.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	Candidate is expected to know vector is for use of dynamic container. List is used when the container need to delete and insert, map is used when search is needed.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference between \lstinline{class} and \lstinline{struct}.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	Member of a class defined with the keyword \lstinline{class} are private by default. Members of a class defined with the keywords \lstinline{struct} or union are public by default.
	The keyword \lstinline{class} can be used to declare template parameters, while the \lstinline{struct} keyword cannot be so used
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference of \lstinline{public}, \lstinline{private} and \lstinline{protected}.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
	Candidate is expected \lstinline{public} allow access from all other classes, \lstinline{protected} allow access from child classes, \lstinline{private} allow access only from declared \lstinline{friend} classes or functions.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is the difference between pointers and references.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
    Candidate is expected to know references is considered as the object itself, cannot be \lstinline{null} like pointers.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question \label{cpp:dynamic_polymorphism}What is polymorphism? Given three geometry types : Rectangle, Triangle, Circle that all need to calculate their area. How would you write those classes? Can you write a virtual constructor? Why?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Polymorphism is the ability to call different methods at run-time based on an object’s dynamic type. 
	\item Candidate is expected to write a BaseGeometry class, and all concrete geometries inherite from this class with a method \lstinline{virtual double calculateArea() const;}.
\end{itemize}
We cannot have a virtual constructor. The virtual function allow to call the function in the inherited class instead of based class, whereas the constructor should be call sucessively in the inheritance hierarchy. Allowing virtual constructor will break this mechanism and the inheritance hierarchy will not be able to build correctly.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question Do you know about factory design pattern, what is used for, give an pratical example. As mentioned in the  \hyperref[cpp:dynamic_polymorphism]{polymorphism} question, how would you draw a simple factory design for those classes?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
The point of factory pattern is during the runtime, objects will be created depending to the action of the user or some evens (random). We don't know a priori what object to be created at compile time, and we need to be able to  create object at runtime. As virtual constructor does not exist, the Factory will help to do the job. The Factory has two principle : register the classes to a internal store (map key to the creational function), and allow to create the objects with the type name.
\begin{lstlisting}
class GeometryFactory{} //TODO
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question What is wrong with the following code?
\begin{lstlisting}
class Analytic
{
  public:
    double getSum() const
    {
      _bufferSum=0;
      for(auto const& elem : mTimeSerie)

      return _bufferSum;
    }

private:
    std::vector<double> mTimeSerie;
    double _bufferSum;
};

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[.2in]
\lstinline{const} member methods cannot modify member variables. Candidate is expected to suggest to set \lstinline{_bufferSum} to \lstinline{mutable}, or use local variable inside the for loop instead of member variable.
\end{solution}

\question Providing a rectangle in 2D plan with coordinates of 4 corners. How to sample 1 millions points uniformly inside the rectangle.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Todo : Candidate is expected to know to distribute 4 points uniformly inside the rectangle. Then generalize the idea to 1M points. The most common way is to be able to calculate the transformation matrix, transform an arbitrary rectangle to the reference rectangle (unit square). The invert of this matrix transform the unit square to the rectangle. Uniformly distribute points inside the unit square is easy, then transform them by mean of transformation matrix.

\question What is a eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Method to find eigenvalues. Is that easy to find eigenvectors?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
Eigenvalues are associated with eigenvectors, describe spectrum spaces of a squared matrix $\mathvec{A}$ by equations 
\[
\lambda\mathvec{x} = \mathvec{A}\mathvec{x}
\]
$\lambda$ is the eigenvalue, $\mathvec{x}$ is the associated eigenvector. Indeed eigenvector is in the kernel of the application (matrix) $\mathvec{A}-\lambda\mathvec{I}$, so eigenvalues can be found by resolve the equation
\[
\text{det}(\mathvec{A}-\lambda\mathvec{I})=0
\]
Eigenvectors or eingenspace can be manually calculated for small matrices. For big matrices, there are a few algorithm to find eigenvectors, implemented in C++.

\right]
\]
Some methods to invert very big matrix 1Mx1M
\begin{solution}[.2in]
There are two methods to revert a small matrix : or calculate determinant, adjoint matrices, then apply the invert formula an simple way is to write an unknown matrix $\mathvec{X}$ and solve the equation $\mathvec{X}\mathvec{A}=\mathvec{I}_2$. The result has to be :
\[
\mathvec{A}^{-1}=
\frac{1}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}
\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
a_{22} & -a_{12}\\
-a_{21} & a_{11}
\end{array} 
\right]
\]
Two basical methods to invert matrices are LU, Conjugated Gradient. The first is direct method which require to store the whole matrix in memory, the second is iterative, don't need to store the matrix in memory, but implement the operation $\mathvec{x}+=\mathvec{A}d\mathvec{x}$

\question Go back to the \hyperref[cpp:dynamic_polymorphism]{polymorphism} question, how would you suggest a design using template in C++. Why template, give your comment on the two design. Do you know the CRTP design?
\begin{solution}[.2in]
The main purpose of using template is it solve problems/calculations at compile time, whereas the polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism) solve problems at run time. The dynamic binding (virtual function) has a cost, even if it is very small, in a real time context where a microsecond is precious, we could consider to use the template instead of polymorphism. It also have the advantage which is all error are solved at compile time. The downside of it is it has limited flexibility, difficult to understand, cannot hide the source code. An example of template for the previous design is to remove the base class, and use the template design :
\begin{lstlisting}
template<typename TGeometry>
double GetArea (const TGeometry& gObj)
{
	 return gObj.getArea();
