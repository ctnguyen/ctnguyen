\paragraph{General idea of the program}
The program has two components : the data feeder in real time, and a analytics API that process the data in real time, analyse and trigger a warning message if it found appropriate. Since the real data feeder could be complicated, we use a 'fake' data feeder. It load the whole offline data from a csv file, then give out one by one element. The Analytics take the data element one by one given by the system, and process it.

\paragraph{To implement}
The candidate has to fill the function \lstinline{AbnormalTrade::process} take a real value in argument, it supposed to be a trading price of a particular security during the day. Candidate can be free to implement this class \lstinline{AbnormalTrade} as far as it inherit from \lstinline{AnalyticsAPI}.

\paragraph{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An csv example of Trade data is provided. Candidate firstly has to implement the function AbnormalTrade::process that discover when the Trade Price move abnormally, in that case, print to console a warning message.
	\item Candidate is then supposed to create a various different data, of different variation and different size (up to 1M) to test the program. Can use Excel/R/Matlab or any tool to generate the data. 
	\item At the end, write a short report (2 pages max) with screenshot commenting how good is the algorithm, in term of accuracy, interm of performance. What was the challenges.
\end{itemize}
